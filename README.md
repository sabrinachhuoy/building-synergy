# Building synergies

## Single-use buildings

Some buildings are highly specialized: a cement plant or a vehicle
assembly plant may be designed so the entire space is committed to one
function. This "used for one thing" model also appears when a building
is owned by the business that occupies it. Single-use buildings may
be necessary (in the case of plants) or nice (offering business owners
control over their space and a sense of long-term place).

But they mean the building owner is responsible for all the thigns that
can go wrong: leaks in the roof, maintaining the parking lot, etc.

## Multi-use buildings

An alternate model has emerged: buildings where businesses rent a
space in them. This means the business doesn't have to worry about
many of the hassles and risks of maintaining property--they can just
worry about the business side.

Sometimes the businesses in a building complement each other.
Think of a medical building, or a building like the Columnbia Tower.
In a building that big, some of the services that one business needs
might be provided by another business inside the same building.

The following are examples of possible synergies:


### Offices that provide a public service

-
-
-

### Offices for support of other offices

-
-
-

### Both/in-between

-
-

### Other tenants?
- Eric
- Sabrina
- Marjorie
- Binyam
- Elias


## Infrastructure

What is provided as part of the building itself, or by building
management? These are often so common that they're easy to overlook,
until something goes wrong with them.
